## Symbolic3 Combinator System - Architecture

**Status:** ✅ Fully Implemented and Tested
**Location:** `src/symbolic3/`

## Overview

Symbolic3 is Tempura's combinator-based symbolic computation library with compile-time evaluation. It provides context-aware transformations, multiple recursion strategies, and composable data flows.

**Historical Note:** Design documents for the combinator system architecture have been archived to `docs/archive/`. The implementation in `src/symbolic3/` is the canonical reference.

## Architecture

Symbolic3 uses a **type-based** approach where expressions are encoded as types:

```cpp
// Each expression is a unique type
Symbol x;
auto expr = x + Constant<2>{};
// Type: Expression<AddOp, Symbol<lambda_unique>, Constant<2>>
```

**Benefits:**

- Zero runtime overhead
- Full compile-time evaluation
- Type-level uniqueness guarantees

**Trade-offs:**

- Large type names for complex expressions
- Slower compilation for deeply nested expressions
- Cannot handle runtime-dynamic expressions

## Current Status (October 2025)

- ✅ **Phase 1 Complete** - All core features implemented and tested
- ✅ 13/13 tests passing
- ✅ Evaluation system with BinderPack
- ✅ Term collection and canonical ordering
- ✅ Fraction support for exact arithmetic
- ✅ Context-aware transformations
- ✅ Full combinator system with multiple strategies

**If symbolic3 (Revolutionary):**

- Months 1-3: Phase 1 (foundation)
- Months 3-5: Phase 2 (pattern matching)
- Months 5-8: Phase 3 (advanced operations)
- Months 8-10: Phase 4 (trig & transcendental)
- Months 10-12: Phase 5 (integration & polish)
- **Result:** Research-grade CAS at compile-time
