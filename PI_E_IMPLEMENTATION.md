# π and e Constants Implementation Summary

**Date:** October 5, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Complete

## What Was Done

### 1. Added π (Pi) and e (Euler's number) to symbolic3

Following the pattern from symbolic2, I added mathematical constants π and e as **zero-argument expressions** rather than numeric approximations.

#### Files Modified:

**`src/symbolic3/operators.h`:**

- Added `PiOp` struct with symbol "π" and evaluation to high-precision value
- Added `EOp` struct with symbol "e" and evaluation to high-precision value
- Added global constants: `constexpr Expression<PiOp> π{}` and `constexpr Expression<EOp> e{}`
- These remain **symbolic** until explicitly evaluated

**`src/symbolic3/ordering.h`:**

- Added `kMeta<EOp>` and `kMeta<PiOp>` to operator ordering array
- Ensures consistent canonical ordering when π and e appear in expressions

**`src/symbolic3/CMakeLists.txt`:**

- Added `pi_e_test` executable to build system

**`src/symbolic3/test/pi_e_test.cpp`:** (NEW)

- 6 comprehensive test cases:
  1. π constant evaluates to ~3.14159...
  2. e constant evaluates to ~2.71828...
  3. π \* 2 evaluates to ~6.28318... (2π)
  4. e^2 evaluates to ~7.38906...
  5. sin(π/2) evaluates to 1.0
  6. e^π evaluates to ~23.1407...
- ✅ All tests passing

### 2. Updated NEXT_STEPS.md with Exact Mathematics Priorities

Added a new **CRITICAL** section at the top documenting the design principles for exact mathematics:

#### Key Principles Documented:

1. **No Implicit Float Evaluation**

   - `1/3` should remain symbolic or become `Fraction<1,3>`, NOT `0.333...`
   - This applies even when operands are typed as floats/ints

2. **Fractions as First-Class Values**

   - Need `Fraction<numerator, denominator>` type for compile-time rationals
   - `0.5_c` should produce `Fraction<1, 2>`, not float `0.5`
   - Automatic GCD reduction: `Fraction<4, 6>` → `Fraction<2, 3>`

3. **Type Absorption Rules**

   - Floats absorb ints/floats but evaluation is still delayed
   - Fractions promote to floats only when explicitly mixed with floats

4. **Exact Symbolic Constants**
   - π and e remain symbolic: `π * 2` → symbolic `2π`, not `6.283...`
   - Only evaluate when explicitly requested via `evaluate()`

#### Priority Roadmap Updated:

- **P0: Exact Mathematics Foundation (NEW)** - 6-8 hours estimated

  - Implement `Fraction<N, D>` type
  - Add GCD-based simplification
  - Restrict constant folding to avoid premature float conversion
  - Add literal suffix `_frac` for fractions
  - Implement type absorption rules

- **P1: Evaluation System** (moved from P0)
- **P2: Term Collection** - ✅ COMPLETED (was P1)
- **P3: Extended Simplification Rules** - ✅ COMPLETED (was P2)

## Design Philosophy: Why Zero-Arg Expressions?

Constants like π and e are implemented as `Expression<PiOp>` (zero-argument expressions) rather than `Constant<3.14159...>` because:

1. **Symbolic Identity**: π is an exact mathematical value, not an approximation
2. **Lazy Evaluation**: Remains symbolic until explicitly evaluated
3. **Pattern Matching**: Can write simplification rules like `sin(π) → 0`
4. **Type System Consistency**: Operations on π are tracked in the type system
5. **No Precision Loss**: Avoids hardcoding truncated floating-point values

## Example Usage

```cpp
using namespace tempura::symbolic3;

// Constants remain symbolic
auto expr1 = π * 2;              // Type: Expression<MulOp, Expression<PiOp>, Constant<2>>
auto expr2 = pow(e, Constant<2>{}); // Type: Expression<PowOp, Expression<EOp>, Constant<2>>

// Symbolic computation
auto expr3 = sin(π / Constant<2>{}); // sin(π/2) stays symbolic

// Explicit evaluation when needed
auto val1 = evaluate(expr1, BinderPack{}); // → 6.28318...
auto val2 = evaluate(expr2, BinderPack{}); // → 7.38906...
auto val3 = evaluate(expr3, BinderPack{}); // → 1.0
```

## Next Steps (from NEXT_STEPS.md)

The priority is now implementing **exact arithmetic with fractions** to prevent expressions like `1/3` from becoming `0.333...`. This aligns with the design principle that symbolic computation should maintain mathematical exactness by default.

See `src/symbolic3/NEXT_STEPS.md` for full implementation details and priorities.
