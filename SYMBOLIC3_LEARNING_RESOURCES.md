### **Topic 1: Term Rewriting Systems & CAS Design**

This is the formal theory behind your `simplify.h` engine. Understanding it more deeply will help you design more robust and efficient simplification strategies.

*   **Books (The Definitive Guides):**
    *   **"Term Rewriting and All That"** by Franz Baader and Tobias Nipkow: This is the canonical, must-read textbook on the subject. It provides the formal foundation for everything from ensuring termination (avoiding infinite loops) to confluence (ensuring a unique result).
    *   **"Computer Algebra and Symbolic Computation"** by Joel S. Cohen: This book is less about the formal theory of rewriting and more about the practical algorithms used inside a CAS, such as polynomial simplification, which is a direct application of these ideas.

*   **Key Concepts to Look For:**
    *   **Abstract Rewriting Systems (ARS):** The most general form of rewriting.
    *   **Termination and Confluence (Church-Rosser Property):** These two properties guarantee that your simplification will always finish and always produce the same result, regardless of the order rules are applied. Your use of a total order on terms is a key technique for ensuring this.
    *   **Knuth-Bendix Completion Algorithm:** An algorithm for converting a set of equations into a confluent term rewriting system.

### **Topic 2: Canonical Forms**

This relates to my recommendation to flatten expressions like `a+b+c` into a single, sorted structure.

*   **Tutorials & Overviews:**
    *   **GeeksforGeeks: "Canonical and Standard Form"**: A good introductory article that explains the difference between "standard" and "canonical" forms, primarily in the context of boolean algebra, but the core concept (a unique representation for equivalent objects) is universal.
    *   **Wikipedia: "Canonical form"**: Provides a solid overview with examples from different areas of mathematics, such as the Jordan Normal Form for matrices and the representation of polynomials.

*   **Practical Application:**
    *   The best way to understand this is to study how existing systems handle polynomials. They are almost always stored in a canonical form (e.g., a sorted list of coefficients and exponents), which makes addition and multiplication much simpler than manipulating a raw expression tree.

### **Topic 3: C++ Template Metaprogramming (TMP) for Symbolic Computation**

This is the C++-specific technique you are using to execute the CAS at compile time.

*   **Talks & Videos (Highly Recommended):**
    *   **CppCon 2023: "Symbolic Calculus for High-performance Computing From Scratch Using C++23" by Vincent Reverdy**: This is *exactly* what you are doing. It's a modern take on using `constexpr` and templates for symbolic calculus and is an absolute must-watch.
    *   **YouTube Search: "C++ Expression Templates"**: This search will yield numerous talks from conferences like CppCon and CppNow. Expression templates are the foundational technique for avoiding temporary objects in C++ numerical libraries and are a close cousin to what you are doing in `symbolic3`.

*   **Papers & Articles:**
    *   **"Compile-Time Symbolic Differentiation Using C++ Expression Templates"** (Kourounis, et al.): An academic paper that details the use of expression templates for compile-time differentiation. This provides formal validation for the approach.
    *   **"The C++ Template Metaprogramming Technique That Runs Code at Compile Time"** (Medium article): A good high-level overview of the benefits and evolution of TMP with modern C++.

### **Topic 4: Debugging `constexpr` and TMP**

This addresses the practical difficulty of figuring out what's going on inside the compiler.

*   **Blog Posts & Articles (Practical Advice):**
    *   **"How to debug C++ constexpr functions"** (Stack Overflow): This thread is a goldmine of practical techniques, including forcing runtime evaluation to use a standard debugger and using `static_assert` for compile-time checks.
    *   **"Printf-style debugging for C++ template metaprograms"** by Ivan Čukić: This article explains the "undefined template" trick to force the compiler to print out the types it has deduced, which is the technique I recommended in the report.

*   **Tools & Advanced Techniques:**
    *   **Templight**: A tool built on Clang for debugging and profiling template metaprograms. It can visualize the instantiation process, which is incredibly helpful for complex TMP.
    *   **CLion's Constexpr Debugger**: If you use the CLion IDE, it has a feature that allows you to step through `constexpr` function execution at compile time, which is a significant quality-of-life improvement.
