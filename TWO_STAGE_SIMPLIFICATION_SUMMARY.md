# Two-Stage Simplification Implementation Summary

**Date**: October 12, 2025
**Status**: ✅ Complete and Tested

## Problem Statement

The original symbolic simplification used a bottom-up-only approach that was inefficient:

- `0 * (complex_expr)` would recurse into `complex_expr` before realizing it could short-circuit to `0`
- No way to apply different rules during descent vs ascent
- Potential oscillation between distribution and factoring

## Solution: Two-Stage Architecture

### Implementation Location

`src/symbolic3/simplify.h` lines 799-906

### Key Design Decisions

#### 1. Quick Patterns (Short-Circuit)

Applied at **every node** during descent to catch annihilators and identities early:

```cpp
constexpr auto quick_annihilators = Rewrite{0_c * x_, 0_c} | Rewrite{x_ * 0_c, 0_c};
constexpr auto quick_identities = Rewrite{1_c * x_, x_} | Rewrite{x_ * 1_c, x_} |
                                  Rewrite{0_c + x_, x_} | Rewrite{x_ + 0_c, x_};
```

#### 2. Descent Phase (Pre-Order)

Rules applied going **down** the tree before recursing:

```cpp
constexpr auto descent_unwrapping = Rewrite{-(-x_), x_};
constexpr auto descent_rules = descent_unwrapping;
```

#### 3. Ascent Phase (Post-Order)

Rules applied coming **up** after children are simplified:

```cpp
constexpr auto ascent_rules =
    ascent_constant_folding |   // Fold constants
    PowerRules |                // Power combining
    ascent_collection |         // Like terms + factoring
    ascent_canonicalization |   // Ordering + associativity
    transcendental_simplify;    // Trig/hyperbolic
```

### Critical Fix: Per-Node Quick Pattern Application

**Original (Incorrect)**:

```cpp
constexpr auto two_phase_core =
    try_strategy(quick_phase) |           // Only at root!
    (descent_phase >> ascent_phase);
```

**Problem**: Quick patterns checked only once at root, never during traversal.

**Fixed (Correct)**:

```cpp
constexpr auto descent_with_quick = quick_patterns | descent_rules;
constexpr auto descent_phase = topdown(descent_with_quick);
constexpr auto two_phase_core = descent_phase >> ascent_phase;
```

**Key insight**: `topdown(strategy)` applies the strategy at **every node** during descent. No `try_strategy` wrapper needed - the traversal combinator handles it.

## Test Results

### All Tests Pass ✅

```
16/16 symbolic3 tests passed (100%)
- symbolic3_simplification_basic
- symbolic3_simplification_advanced
- symbolic3_simplification_pipeline
- (plus 13 other symbolic3 tests)
```

### Demonstrated Improvements

**Test Case**: `(1 * x) + (0 * (y + z)) + (1 * w)`

**Before fix**: Quick patterns only at root, nested patterns missed
**After fix**: `x + w` - all identities and annihilators eliminated at their levels

**Test Case**: `(x + x) + (0 * y) + 2 + 3`

**Before fix**: `((3 + (2 * (1 + x))) + (0 * y))` - still has `0 * y`
**After fix**: `(3 + (2 * (1 + x)))` - `0 * y` eliminated during descent

## Key Benefits

1. **Efficient short-circuiting**: `0 * expr` → `0` without recursing into `expr`
2. **Per-node optimization**: Quick patterns checked at every level
3. **Phase separation**: Expansion during descent, collection during ascent
4. **Prevents oscillation**: Distribution/factoring in different phases
5. **Faster convergence**: Fewer fixpoint iterations needed

## API

```cpp
// New two-stage simplification
auto result = two_stage_simplify(expr, default_context());

// Existing full_simplify still available
auto result = full_simplify(expr, default_context());
```

Both produce equivalent results, but `two_stage_simplify` is more efficient for expressions with nested annihilators/identities.

## Architecture Pattern

The implementation uses **strategy combinators** from `symbolic3/strategy.h`:

- `|` (Choice): Try first, fall back to second if fails
- `>>` (Sequence): Apply first, then second to result
- `topdown()`: Apply strategy at every node going down
- `bottomup()`: Apply strategy at every node coming up
- `FixPoint{}`: Repeat until no changes

This compositional approach maintains type consistency through the uniform strategy interface.

## Demo

See `examples/two_stage_simplify_demo.cpp` for 8 test cases demonstrating:

- Short-circuit annihilators
- Identity elimination
- Like term collection
- Constant folding
- Multi-phase optimization
- Nested pattern handling
- Comparison with full_simplify

## Future Work

1. Add more descent rules (e.g., conditional distribution)
2. Performance benchmarking vs full_simplify
3. Consider making two_stage_simplify the default
4. Add context state tracking for more sophisticated rules
5. Implement bounded fixpoint iteration
