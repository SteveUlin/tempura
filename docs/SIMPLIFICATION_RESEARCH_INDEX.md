# Simplification Strategy Research - Documentation Index

## Overview

This research investigates advanced term rewriting strategies for improving symbolic simplification efficiency while maintaining elegant rule definitions.

**Research Question:** How can we avoid unnecessary work in simplification (e.g., `0 * complex_expr` should return 0 immediately) while keeping rules simple and declarative?

**Answer:** Use different evaluation strategies for different pattern types (outermost for short-circuits, innermost for collection, two-phase for complex pipelines).

## Key Concepts

### Evaluation Strategies

| Strategy      | Direction           | Use For            | Example             |
| ------------- | ------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------- |
| **Outermost** | Top-down with retry | Short-circuits     | `0 * x → 0`         |
| **Innermost** | Bottom-up           | Collection         | `x + x → 2x`        |
| **Two-Phase** | Both                | Complex pipelines  | Expand then collect |
| **CSE**       | Compile-time        | Identical children | `(x+x)+(x+x)`       |

### Rule Organization

```
DESCENT (going down)        ASCENT (coming up)
────────────────────        ──────────────────
• Annihilators              • Constant folding
• Identities                • Like-term collection
• Expansion                 • Factoring
• Unwrapping                • Canonical ordering
```

## Implementation Phases

### ✅ Phase 1: Short-Circuit (Recommended First)

- **Impact:** High (100× for annihilators)
- **Complexity:** Low (10 lines of code)
- **Risk:** Low (additive change)

### 🎯 Phase 2: Two-Phase (Most Elegant)

- **Impact:** High (2-3× overall)
- **Complexity:** Medium (reorganize rules)
- **Risk:** Medium (requires testing)

### 🔧 Phase 3: CSE (Optional)

- **Impact:** Medium (4× for duplicates)
- **Complexity:** Medium (type-level detection)
- **Risk:** Low (compile-time only)

## Integration Checklist

When implementing, consider:

- [ ] Choose phase (1, 2, or both)
- [ ] Decide API approach (replace vs add vs configure)
- [ ] Write tests for edge cases
- [ ] Benchmark performance gains
- [ ] Update existing documentation
- [ ] Consider compile-time impact
- [ ] Verify all existing tests pass
- [ ] Add examples to README

## Contact & Feedback

This research was conducted to address the specific concern:

> "Right now we try to simplify the bottom node, then go up a level and try again. After reaching the top, we do the whole process again. If nothing changes, we return the result. This is inefficient and does not offer us a lot of flexibility with the simplification state machine."

The findings demonstrate that different patterns benefit from different traversal orders, and the proof-of-concept shows how to implement this elegantly.
